RFID based Digitized Smart Solution to the Existing Method of Writing  Medical Prescription and Drug Regulation


The existing method of writing prescriptions in a piece of paper by a doctor is very inefficient,
could not keep track of the patient’s history and the legibility of the writing poses a setback to
the pharmacies. Therefore I intend to greatly improvise the existing method by digitizing the
whole system and providing a smarter way to prescribe medicines. In this new system, doctors
would be provided with a RFID prescriber (a RFID-Arduino based “Smart Kit”) device which will
be connected to their computer using a USB connection and software installed in their
computer. And when he wants to prescribe a medicine to his patient, this software along with
the device can be used to prescribe the medicines in a Smart card (RFID card) to the patient as
needed. Now,the patient can carry this smart card to the pharmacy to purchase the medicines.
The Pharmacist, with the help of the Smart Kit connected to his computer and by another
software can now easily read the prescription from the RFID card and provide medicines to the
customer without any confusion caused by the legibility of the writing by the doctor. With this,
the pharmacist can raise the bill easily in his computer without wasting any time. The patient
need not worry about the confidentiality of his disease, because no one can read his
prescription till he gets the medicine.

Required Items (for the Smart Kit)-
1.Arduino Uno/Nano
2.Mifare RC522 RFID Module with RFID ID Cards
3.Usb connecting PC to Embedded system
4.LED Lights
5.Buzzer (Optional)
